Fractal theory based Acceptance Rejection Monte-Carlo (FARMC) algorithm models the permeability of any type of sandstone reservoir using gamma-ray and density logs. The code is written in Matlab (version R2016) and provide a graphical interface (GUI) allowing the user to  input parameters and obtaing the results.
